Title: Surrogate Residuals for Ordinal and General Regression Models
Description: An implementation of the surrogate approach to residuals and 
  diagnostics for ordinal and general regression models; for details, see Liu 
  and Zhang (2017, <doi:https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.2017.1292915>) and Greenwell et al. 
  (2017, <https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2018/RJ-2018-004/index.html>). 
  These residuals can be used to construct standard residual plots for model 
  diagnostics (e.g., residual-vs-fitted value plots, residual-vs-covariate plots, 
  Q-Q plots, etc.). The package also provides an 'autoplot' function for producing 
  standard diagnostic plots using 'ggplot2' graphics. The package currently supports 
  cumulative link models from packages 'MASS', 'ordinal', 'rms', and 'VGAM'. 
  Support for binary regression models using the standard 'glm' function is also 
  available.
